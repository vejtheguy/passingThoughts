## Passing Thoughts...

**Passing Thoughts...** is a simple, non-persistent web app built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **EJS**, and styled using **Bootstrap** and custom CSS.

The concept behind the app is straightforward: users can create short posts—fleeting thoughts—that won't last forever. Once the server restarts, all posts are cleared, emphasizing the temporary nature of the content, just like thoughts that pass through the mind.
